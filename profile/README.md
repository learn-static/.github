# Learn-STATIC

> Powering Digital Humanities Teaching and Learning with Static Web Approaches

Welcome to the Learn-STATIC organization, a home for Digital Humanities-focued static web teaching modules and project templates.
The inter-institutional team behind the Learn-STATIC initiative was funded by an NEH Digital Humanities Advancement Grant in 2021 to create the following initial tools:

- 5 Foundational Learning Modules covering basic introductory concepts in static web development:
  - GitHub
  - HTML/CSS
  - Markdown
  - Data
  - Computational Methods
  
- 4 DH classroom static web project templates and accompanying documentation:
  - Digital Collections
  - Digital Oral Histories
  - Text Analysis
  - Digital Project Recovery

Librarians and Humanities faculty at the University of Idaho and University of Oregon will develop and pilot these educational tools over the 2021-2022 school year, and release them for public use in the summer of 2022. 
Learn-STATIC tools and the methodology behind them stem from the digital collections platform [CollectionBuilder](https://collectionbuilder.github.io/) and the [Lib-STATIC](https://lib-static.github.io/) community.
